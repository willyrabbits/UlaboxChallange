# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Considerations

* I could have added more info in the detail screen, but I think that it would not demostrate my knowlodege (I already had the data, and I have demonstrate that I know how to make a proper use of HTML, CSS & JS)

* I made a basic design to have some starting point (https://www.figma.com/proto/9skvNtstuoze5bNLjfpcIP/Ulabox-Weather?node-id=1%3A8&viewport=-3435%2C944%2C1.6768354177474976&frame-preset-name=Desktop&scaling=min-zoom). I did not follow it 100% but it helped me to have a global idea of the project.


# Future steps

* Improve tests done with 'react testing library', some basics are done, but needs to be improved.

* Implement Jest test. Currently Test are done with React Testing Library which is complatible with Jest.

* Fecth list of cities from somewhere else (curently they are 'hardcoded' in a data file). This way it will be more dynamic and we'll have more options to choose.
